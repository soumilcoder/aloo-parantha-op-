Steps: 

Dough: Take flour in a bowl. Slowly add water while mixing and keep on kneading until your dough is ready. 

Potato Filling: Boil potatoes. Peel and mash them. Add thinly cut onions, ginger, and green coriander. Add green chillies, salt, black pepper, garam masala, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and amchur. Mix all the ingredients well. 

Cooking the Parantha: Take a small ball of dough and roll it with a rolling pin into a small roti. Then add the filling in the center of the roti and cover the filling with the sides of the roti. Press it slightly and sprinkle some dry flour on both sides. Roll it again to the desired size. Lay the roti on a preheated tava and let cook on one side. Flip it over to cook the other side. Apply some butter on both sides to fry it. Remove it from the tava and serve it with butter and yogurt.
